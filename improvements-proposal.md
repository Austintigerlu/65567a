1. I would either use Axios or Fetch to make the data request. I would most likely use Axios since it can support a wider range of browsers. Axios also automatically stringifies the data, can intercept HTTP requests, and help show download progress. To create the hook, I would useState and useEffect to help in requesting the data. 
2. The Nano ID is not consistent among all renders. A stable key should be used for the key. Inside the documentation for nanoid it states it should not be used for keys in lists. It can cause the reconciliation process to view every element as new or changed and can force the component to constantly rerender.
